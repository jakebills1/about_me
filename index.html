            <p>Jake Bills is an electric and upright bassist working in Salt Lake City, Utah, well known for his fluency in a multitude of styles including jazz, pop, R & B, and classical.</p>
            <p>Jake received his Bachelor of Music with emphasis in Jazz Performance from the University of Utah in May 2015. Under the tutelage of Dr. Denson Angulo, he has studied contemporary and classic jazz styles, transcribed and performed solos by famous jazz artists such as Niels Henning Orsted Pederson, Ray Brown, Esperanza Spalding, Jaco Pastorious, Steve Swallow, Charles Mingus, and Chet Baker, transcribed compositions and arrangements by artists such as Charlie Parker, Charles Mingus, and Bill Evans, and performed a selection from the Cello Suites of J.S. Bach. Jake has perfomed with several Utah student ensembles of note: the Jazz Repertory Ensemble, who perfomed with Tito Carrillo(trumpet, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) and Paul Ferguson(trombone, director of jazz studies at Case Western Reserve University), the Jazz Sextet, who performed at the 2013 Jamey Aebersold Jazz Festival at the University of Northern Colorado-Greeley, and the Jazz Octet who, under the leadership of Russell Schmidt, toured the Bay Area in 2014. He also received the Charles Patrick Halliday Jazz Scholarship.</p>
            <p>Jake's experience with music started much earlier than his time at the University of Utah. He began learning bass at age 10 and joined his first performing band at 12. He was a student of the School of Rock Utah, one location of an international franchise of youth music schools that emphasize the teaching of diverse music including Led Zeppelin, Stevie Wonder, and the Beastie Boys, from ages 14-19. During that time he was selected twice to perform with the All-stars, an audition-only touring group picked from the best each school has to offer. It was through this experience that Jake developed the deep knowledge of and connection to contemporary and classic rock, pop, and soul repertoire which informs his playing to this day. He is now a faculty member at the School, maintaining a bass studio and directing one of the School's performing groups.</p>
            <p>Jake is currently a freelance bassist working in Utah and surrounding states. He performs wth a diversity of groups including jazz combos, pop and rock cover bands, and country singer-songwriters. He is available to hire for performance in all styles, studio work, education, and composition</p>
